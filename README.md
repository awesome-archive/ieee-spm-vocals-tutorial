* [Tutorial 2 - Vocalist ID and Similarity](https://github.com/spotify/ieee-spm-vocals-tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial%202%20-%20Vocalist%20Identification.ipynb)
* [Tutorial 3 - Sung Language ID](https://github.com/spotify/ieee-spm-vocals-tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial%203%20-%20Sung%20Language%20ID.ipynb)


## Dependencies

More detailed instructions to follow, but the necessary dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.


## Getting Help

Please note that these tutorials are meant to serve as light guidance toward tackling different challenges in singing voice analysis, and are in something resembling an alpha state currently.
